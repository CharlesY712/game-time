# Game Time!
## Jonathan Sweet and Charles Yach

The purpose of this project was to get practice with objects, inheritance, ES6 syntax, and the HTML Canvas element. We utilized TDD with Mocha and Chai, Babel to ensure browser compatibility with ES6, and ESLint to ensure consistently readable code. Additionally, we use webpack to bundle our files and take a modular approach.
